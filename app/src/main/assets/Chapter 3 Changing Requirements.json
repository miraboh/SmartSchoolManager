  "text": "The immediate cause of the degradation of the design is well understood. The require-ments have been changing in ways that the initial design did not anticipate. Often these changes need to be made quickly, and may be made by engineers who are not familiar with the original design philosophy. So, though the change to the design works, it somehow violates the original design. Bit by bit, as the changes continue to pour in, these violations accumulate until malignancy sets in. However, we cannot blame the drifting of the requirements for the degradation of the design. We, as software engineers, know full well that requirements change. Indeed, most of us realize that the requirements document is the most volatile document in the project. If our designs are failing due to the constant rain of changing requirements, it is our designs that are at fault. We must somehow find a way to make our designs resilient to such changes and protect them from rotting."
