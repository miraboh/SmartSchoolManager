  "text": "Of all the principles of object oriented design, this is the most important. It originated from the work of Bertrand Meyer2. It means simply this: We should write our mod-ules so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. In other words, we want to be able to change what the modules do, without changing the source code of the modules.This may sound contradictory, but there are several techniques for achieving the OCP on a large scale. All of these techniques are based upon abstraction. Indeed, abstrac-tion is the key to the OCP. Several of these techniques are described below.Dynamic Polymorphism. Consider Listing 2-1. the LogOn function must be changed every time a new kind of modem is added to the software. Worse, since each different type of modem depends upon the Modem::Type enumeration, each modem must be recompiled every time a new kind of modem is added."
