  "text": "What kind of changes cause designs to rot? Changes that introduce new and unplanned for dependencies. Each of the four symptoms mentioned above is either directly, or indirectly caused by improper dependencies between the modules of the software. It is the dependency architecture that is degrading, and with it the ability of the software to be maintained.In order to forestall the degradation of the dependency architecture, the dependencies between modules in an application must be managed. This management consists of the creation of dependency firewalls. Accross such firewalls, dependencies do not propogate.Object Oriented Design is replete with principles and techniques for building such firewalls, and for managing module dependencies. It is these principles and tech-niques that will be discussed in the remainder of this chapter. First we will examine the principles, and then the techniques, or design patterns, that help maintain the dependency architecture of an application."
